# Tectonic Plate Simulator
This is a (very) work in progress online tectonic plate simulator. It is being developed in collaboration with UIC. The website is not active yet, check back for releases.

## Packages 
Currently this app is running on React 19, which was breaking for many npm packages. The app's current package list has conflicts but works if installed using --force.
